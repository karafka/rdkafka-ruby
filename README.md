> [!NOTE]
> **Karafka-Rdkafka** is a fork of the [rdkafka-ruby](https://github.com/karafka/rdkafka-ruby) gem, specifically maintained for the [Karafka ecosystem](https://karafka.io). This fork exists to provide Karafka-specific patches and optimizations that are not generic enough for inclusion in the upstream rdkafka-ruby library.

---

## Why This Fork Exists

While rdkafka-ruby serves as an excellent general-purpose Kafka client for Ruby, Karafka requires specific optimizations and patches that are:

- **Karafka-specific**: Tailored for Karafka's unique processing patterns and requirements
- **Performance-oriented**: Focused on high-throughput, low-latency scenarios that Karafka specializes in
- **Framework-integrated**: Designed to work seamlessly with Karafka's architecture and features

These modifications are not suitable for the upstream rdkafka-ruby library because they are either too specific to Karafka's use cases or might introduce breaking changes for other users of rdkafka-ruby.

## Maintenance and Synchronization

This fork is actively maintained and kept in sync with the upstream rdkafka-ruby repository as much as possible. We:

- **Regularly merge** upstream changes from rdkafka-ruby
- **Maintain compatibility** with the rdkafka-ruby API wherever possible
- **Apply minimal patches** to avoid diverging significantly from upstream
- **Merge back generic improvements** from karafka-rdkafka to rdkafka-ruby when they benefit the broader community
- **Test thoroughly** to ensure stability within the Karafka ecosystem

## Long-term Plan

Our long-term goal is to work with the rdkafka-ruby maintainers to eventually merge the beneficial changes back upstream. This would allow us to:

- Reduce maintenance overhead
- Benefit the broader Ruby Kafka community
- Simplify the Karafka ecosystem dependencies

However, until such integration is possible, this fork ensures that Karafka users get the best possible performance and reliability.

### If You're Using Standalone rdkafka

You should use the [original rdkafka-ruby gem](https://github.com/karafka/rdkafka-ruby) for general Kafka client needs. This fork is specifically designed for Karafka and may not be suitable for other use cases.

### Reporting Issues

For issues related to this fork, please report them in the [rdkafka-ruby repository](https://github.com/karafka/rdkafka-ruby/issues) rather than here. This helps us:

- Maintain a single place for issue tracking
- Ensure upstream compatibility
- Provide better support for all users

### Contributing

Contributions should generally be made to the upstream [rdkafka-ruby repository](https://github.com/karafka/rdkafka-ruby). Changes to this fork are only made when:

- They are specific to Karafka's requirements
- They cannot be generalized for upstream inclusion
- They are temporary while working on upstream integration
