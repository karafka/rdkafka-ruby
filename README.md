> [!NOTE]
> The `rdkafka-ruby` gem was created and developed by [AppSignal](https://www.appsignal.com/). Their impactful contributions have significantly shaped the Ruby Kafka and Karafka ecosystems. For robust monitoring, we highly recommend AppSignal.

---

The `rdkafka` gem is a modern Kafka client library for Ruby based on
[librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/).
It wraps the production-ready C client using the [ffi](https://github.com/ffi/ffi)
gem and targets Kafka 1.0+ and Ruby versions under security or
active maintenance. We remove a Ruby version from our CI builds when they 
become EOL.

`rdkafka` was written because of the need for a reliable Ruby client for Kafka that supports modern Kafka at [AppSignal](https://appsignal.com). AppSignal runs it in production on very high-traffic systems.

The most important pieces of a Kafka client are implemented. We're
working towards feature completeness. You can track that here:

## Installation

This gem downloads and compiles librdkafka when it is installed. If you
If you have any problems installing the gem, please open an issue.

## Usage

See the [documentation](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/appsignal/rdkafka-ruby) for full details on how to use this gem. Two quick examples:

### Consuming messages

Subscribe to a topic and get messages. Kafka will automatically spread
the available partitions over consumers with the same group id.

```ruby
config = {
  :"bootstrap.servers" => "localhost:9092",
  :"group.id" => "ruby-test"
}
consumer = Rdkafka::Config.new(config).consumer
consumer.subscribe("ruby-test-topic")

consumer.each do |message|
  puts "Message received: #{message}"
end
```

### Producing messages

Produce a number of messages, put the delivery handles in an array, and
wait for them before exiting. This way the messages will be batched and
efficiently sent to Kafka.

```ruby
config = {:"bootstrap.servers" => "localhost:9092"}
producer = Rdkafka::Config.new(config).producer
delivery_handles = []

100.times do |i|
  puts "Producing message #{i}"
  delivery_handles << producer.produce(
      topic:   "ruby-test-topic",
      payload: "Payload #{i}",
      key:     "Key #{i}"
  )
end

delivery_handles.each(&:wait)
```

Note that creating a producer consumes some resources that will not be
released until it `#close` is explicitly called, so be sure to call
`Config#producer` only as necessary.

## Higher level libraries

Currently, there are two actively developed frameworks based on rdkafka-ruby, that provide higher-level API that can be used to work with Kafka messages and one library for publishing messages.

### Message processing frameworks

* [Karafka](https://github.com/karafka/karafka) - Ruby and Rails efficient Kafka processing framework.
* [Racecar](https://github.com/zendesk/racecar) - A simple framework for Kafka consumers in Ruby 

### Message publishing libraries

* [WaterDrop](https://github.com/karafka/waterdrop) â€“ Standalone Karafka library for producing Kafka messages.

## Development

A Docker Compose file is included to run Kafka. To run
that:

```
docker-compose up
```

Run `bundle` and `cd ext && bundle exec rake && cd ..` to download and
compile `librdkafka`.

You can then run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests. To see rdkafka
debug output:

```
DEBUG_PRODUCER=true bundle exec rspec
DEBUG_CONSUMER=true bundle exec rspec
```

After running the tests, you can bring the cluster down to start with a
clean slate:

```
docker-compose down
```

## Example

To see everything working, run these in separate tabs:

```
bundle exec rake consume_messages
bundle exec rake produce_messages
```
